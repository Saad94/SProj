I am vehemently opposed to LUMS because of the incredible mismanagement being conducted by the RO. LUMS is a den of disgusting, spoilt brats who become so because of indulgent parents who do not know how to say no. There is a wide variety of food options, consequently, people in LUMS are happy and content. However, due to the good food, people are prone to overeating and overspending.
